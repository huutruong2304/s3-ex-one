Please convert mic.html into React.

Basic level (must-have):
1. Look and feel must be exactly the same with the original HTML. No mis-alignments, extra paddings etc.
2. Dropdown is not required.

Bonus level (optional if time allows):
1. Implement all dropdown and menu (3 dots beside dropdown) actions.

Have fun! :)
